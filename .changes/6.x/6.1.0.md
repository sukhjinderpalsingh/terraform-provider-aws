## 6.1.0 (June 26, 2025)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Terraform AWS Provider version `v6.1.0` was [removed](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/43213) from the Terraform Registry shortly after release due to a [significant bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/43199) that could not be remediated quickly.
>
> All changes originally included in the removed release are included in version [`v6.2.0`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#620-july--2-2025).
